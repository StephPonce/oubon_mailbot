<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective:</strong> <span id="eff"></span></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Oubon Shop</strong> (“Oubon,” “we,” “us”) collects, uses, and shares information
when you use our websites, Shopify integrations, AI assistants, product-research tools, and related services (collectively, the “Services”).</p>

<h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account &amp; Contact</strong>: name, email, store URL, business details.</li>
  <li><strong>Store &amp; Order Data (via Shopify)</strong>: product listings, inventory, orders, customers’ contact/shipping info as needed
      to provide the Services. Access is limited to the scopes you authorize.</li>
  <li><strong>Communications</strong>: messages you send to our support email, in-app chat, or via connected inboxes (e.g., Gmail).</li>
  <li><strong>Usage &amp; Device</strong>: logs, IP address, timestamps, and basic device/browser info.</li>
  <li><strong>Research Signals</strong> (optional sources you connect): trend and sentiment inputs from platforms such as
      TikTok, Instagram, X/Twitter, Reddit, AliExpress/Alibaba, Google Trends, and other supplier catalogs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Provide &amp; improve the Services</strong> and operate our Shopify integrations.</li>
  <li><strong>Product Research</strong>: analyze market signals (e.g., TikTok/IG trends, supplier catalogs, reviews, pricing, and sentiment)
      to recommend products and content for your store.</li>
  <li><strong>AI-Assisted Workflows</strong>: draft product descriptions, summarize emails, propose replies, or schedule posts/ad drafts.
      Automated actions that could change your storefront require your approval unless you explicitly enable auto-publish.</li>
  <li><strong>Communications</strong>: respond to support requests and send important notices.</li>
  <li><strong>Security &amp; Compliance</strong>: detect abuse, debug issues, and meet legal obligations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3) Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
<p>Performance of a contract, legitimate interests (e.g., securing and improving the Services), and consent where required.</p>

<h2>4) Sharing of Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: hosting, analytics, error monitoring, AI inference (e.g., model providers),
      email and notification services, each bound by confidentiality.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrated Platforms</strong>: Shopify, TikTok, Meta (Facebook/Instagram), X/Twitter, Reddit, AliExpress/Alibaba,
      Google APIs—limited to what’s necessary to deliver the features you enable.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal/Compliance</strong>: to comply with law, enforce terms, or protect rights and safety.</li>
  <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale with appropriate protections.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5) Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain information only as long as necessary for the purposes above or as required by law. You can request deletion of your data (subject to legal/operational constraints) at any time.</p>

<h2>6) Security</h2>
<p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>7) International Transfers</h2>
<p>Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs).</p>

<h2>8) Your Rights</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>EEA/UK</strong>: access, correct, delete, restrict, object, and data portability. You may also lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</li>
  <li><strong>California</strong>: access, delete, correct, opt-out of certain sharing; we do not knowingly sell personal information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9) Children</h2>
<p>Our Services are not intended for children under 13 (or as defined by local law). We do not knowingly collect their data.</p>

<h2>10) Changes to this Policy</h2>
