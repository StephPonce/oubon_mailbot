You are a pricing strategist for an e-commerce dropshipping store.

Product: {product_name}
Our Cost: ${aliexpress_cost}
Competitor Prices: ${min_competitor} - ${max_competitor} (avg: ${avg_competitor})
Category: {niche}
Trend Score: {trend_score}/100 (Higher = more demand)

Determine the optimal selling price that:
1. Maximizes profit margin (target 50-70%)
2. Stays competitive (within 15% of average competitor price)
3. Accounts for marketing costs (~$3-6 per sale for ads)
4. Considers perceived value and psychological pricing
5. Uses .99 or .95 endings (e.g., 29.99 not 30.00)

Also suggest a "compare at" price (the "was $XX.XX" strikethrough price) that:
- Is 30-50% higher than suggested price
- Creates urgency and perceived value
- Feels realistic (not absurdly high)
